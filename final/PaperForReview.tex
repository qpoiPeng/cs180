%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   In this project, we proposed an algorithm to determine where a photo was taken within a specific area. Using a dataset of numerous images from that area, we applied a Gaussian pyramid to perform multi-scale Harris corner detection and utilized Adaptive Non-Maximum Suppression (ANMS) to extract uniformly distributed image features. We then formulated the image-matching problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Through these procedures, we matched the target image to another image in our dataset, accurately determining the target image's location. Our approach achieved an accuracy 84.6\%, demonstrating the feasibility of using ILP to address image-matching problems.

\section{Introduction}
``Where am I?'' Accurately determining one's location is critical for navigation and safety. Current systems usually rely on GPS to locate one's position. However, GPS may struggle in environments with poor signal reception, such as rural areas or forests. Therefore, we propose an offline method to estimate the user's location based on a photo they took. First, we collect a large dataset that contains paired information on the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) and corresponding images. Then, we compare the user-provided target image with the images in the database and output the most likely location where the target image was captured. Conceptually, this works like the inverse of Google Street View: instead of determining what a location looks like based on coordinates, it deduces the current location based on the input photo. 

For instance, a user could take a photo as a target photo anywhere in downtown Berkeley, and the system would output the precise 2-D geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of their location. Specifically, we used a multi-scale interest point detector and Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression (ANMS) \cite{1467310} to identify potential correspondences between images. We then formulate the likelihood that two images depict the same location as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem and identify the best matches \cite{torresani2008feature}. Finally, we output the geographical coordinates of the best-matched image in the database as the result. In this method, as long as the user has access to a local database, they can calculate the location of any photo within the database's coverage without internet or GPS access.

Our experiments show that finding matches by solving ILP can effectively find correct image matches, leading to an accuracy of 84.6\% in the proposed method.

\section{Problem Statement}

Given an area $A$ and a target image $T$ taken within this area, our system aims to output a location $(T_{lon}, T_{lat}) \in A$ where $T$ is taken. 

To achieve this, we first collect an image dataset $S$ that contains all the street views in $A$. Each image $I \in S$ has a label $(I_{lon}, I_{lat})$ indicating the longitude and latitude of where the image is taken. Secondly, we compute a score $f_T(I)$ indicating how well $I$ matches $T$. Finally, we see which image $I \in S$ has the highest score and output its location $(I_{lon}, I_{lat})$ as an estimation of where $T$ is taken. 

\section{Methodology}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{fig/alg.png}
   \caption{The main process.}
   \label{fig:alg}
\end{figure}

Our approach consists of two parts. First, given an area $A$, we need to collect all street views in $A$ to form the dataset. Second, we need to compare each image in the dataset with the target image and compute their matching score. This section provides details of these two steps. A visualized pipeline of the algorithm can be found in Fig. \ref{fig:alg}.

\subsection{Data Collection}
We used Google Street View to construct our dataset. Google Street View provides an API that we can download images by specifying latitude and longitude. Moreover, it includes images captured from different pitch angles and fields of view, which enables our dataset to comprehensively cover various photos, thereby enhancing the robustness of our model. 

We collected 2 datasets. The first one is along Telegraph Avenue, the 400m segment from Bancroft Way to Dwight Way. The latitude ranges from [37.8652, 37.8687], and the longitude ranges from [\textminus122.2592, \textminus122.2585]. We set a data point every 5 meters and downloaded 8 street views facing different directions (mostly east and west because buildings are located on these two sides) and with different fields of view. There are total of 608 images in this dataset. 

The first dataset is along Channing Way, the 770m segment from Shattuck Avenue to Telegraph Avenue. The latitude ranges from [37.8658, 37.8668], and the longitude ranges from [\textminus122.2673, \textminus122.2589]. We set a data point every 7 meters and downloaded 8 street views facing different directions (mostly north and south because buildings are located on these two sides) and with different fields of view. There are total of 832 images in this dataset. 

The target images in our experiments, are captured by mobile phone within the two areas mentioned above, focusing mainly on buildings. This shows that even when the target images originate from a different source than our dataset, our method remains effective.



\subsection{Image Matching Algorithm}

Essentially, this is an image matching problem, as our goal is to find how well two images $T$ and $I$ match. The first step is to compute the Harris scores of both images and detect their corners. \cite{Harris88alvey} Here, we went beyond Project 4 and implemented a Gaussian pyramid to detect multiscaled corners to account for the scale-invariance of the two images. Then we use ANMS \cite{1467310} to limit the number of corners. 

Next, for each detected corner $c_T$ of $T$, we find two corners $c_{I,1}$, $c_{I,2}$ of $I$ such that they are corners with the closest and second closest distance to $c_T$. Here, the distance between two corners is defined as the L2 distance of their surrounding pixels convoluted with a Gaussian filter. We obtain a set $C$ of 50 pairs of corresponding corners by 
\[
    C = \{(c_T, c_{I,1}) | g(c_T, c_{I,1}) \leq g_{thres}\}
\]
where 
\[
    g(c_T, c_{I,1}) = \frac{dist(c_T, c_{I,1})}{dist(c_T, c_{I,2})}
\]
and $g_{thres}$ is the 50th smallest value among all $g(c_T, c_{I,1})$. In other words, we match the corners in $T$ and $I$ according to their surrounding feature similarities, which is evaluated by distance to the nearest neighbor over distance to the second nearest neighbor (recall 1-NN/2-NN in lecture slides), and keep the 50 pairs with lowest scores. \cite{Lowe04}

Suppose $T$ and $I$ both contain a specific building. Since they are taken at different positions from different angles, there is no homography correspondence between them. Therefore, we cannot directly use the RANSAC approach (as we did in Project 4) to map one image to another. However, observe that since street view photos are often (almost always) taken on the road or sidewalk, we can assume that the camera is surrounded by some flat surfaces (walls, ground, sky) and all 3D objects in the real world are just 2D objects on these surfaces. Therefore, we do not need to worry that the order of objects changes when viewing from different angles. (There are counter-examples though, such as trees planted on the sidewalk may come as left or right of other background objects when seen from different views.) In other words, a building always looks like the same building regardless of what perspective you look at it. If there is a window right above the door, the window appears right above the door in every single photo of the building. This implies that if some corners in $T$ correspond to some corners in $I$, it is likely that these corners preserve their relative positions in both images. On the other hand, if $T$ and $I$ are different scenes, the positions of corresponding corners will be completely random. 

To formally state the idea of ``preserve relative position'', consider three corresponding pairs $(A_1, B_1), (A_2, B_2), (A_3, B_3) \in C$. The following statements are equivalent: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\{A_1, A_2, A_3\}$ and $\{B_1, B_2, B_3\}$ preserve relative position. 
    \item $A_1$ falls on the left side of $\overline{A_2, A_3}$ iff. $B_1$ falls on the left side of $\overline{B_2, B_3}$.
    \item Traversing $A_1, A_2, A_3$ in $\triangle A_1A_2A_3$ is a counterclockwise path iff. traversing $B_1, B_2, B_3$ in $\triangle B_1B_2B_3$ is a counterclockwise path. 
    \item \overrightharp{$A_1A_2$}$\times$\overrightharp{$A_1A_3$}$>0$ iff. \overrightharp{$B_1B_2$}$\times$\overrightharp{$B_1B_3$}$>0$ 
\end{itemize}
In our implementation, we compare the cross products as it is the easiest one to implement. 

Note that $\{A_1, A_2, A_3\}$ and $\{B_1, B_2, B_3\}$ preserve relative position does not guarantee anything. However, if $\{A_1, A_2, A_3\}$ and $\{B_1, B_2, B_3\}$ do not preserve relative position, we can learn a very important information that at least one of $(A_1, B_1), (A_2, B_2), (A_3, B_3)$ is an incorrect match. 

Now, we can apply the idea of RANSAC \cite{RANSAC}, which is to find consensus among the matches. In particular, we want to find the maximum subset $\sigma$ of $C$ in which each correspondence pair agrees with each other. The subset $\sigma$ can also be regarded as the ``inliers''. 

Let the 50 elements of $C$ be $(A_i, B_i), 1\leq i\leq50$. Let $x_i \in \{0, 1\}$ indicates whether $(A_i, B_i) \in \sigma$. To maximize the number of inliers is to maximize $\sum_{i=1}^{50} x_i$. On the other hand, if $\{A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, A_{i_3}\}$ and $\{B_{i_1}, B_{i_2}, B_{i_3}\}$ do not preserve relative position, then $(A_{i_1}, B_{i_1}), (A_{i_2}, B_{i_2}), (A_{i_3}, B_{i_3})$ cannot co-exist as inliers, so $x_{i_1}+x_{i_2}+x_{i_3}\leq 2$. We can formally state the maximization problem as 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \max_{x_i\in\{0,1\}} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{50}x_i\\
        \textrm{s.t.} \quad & x_{i_1}+x_{i_2}+x_{i_3}\leq 2 \textrm{ if } \textrm{sign}\left(\textrm{\overrightharp{$A_{i_1}A_{i_2}$}}\times\textrm{\overrightharp{$A_{i_1}A_{i_3}$}}\right)\\
        & \neq\textrm{sign}\left(\textrm{\overrightharp{$B_{i_1}B_{i_2}$}}\times\textrm{\overrightharp{$B_{i_1}B_{i_3}$}}\right)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This is simply an integer linear programming (ILP). Although it is well-known that ILP is an NP-complete problem, nowadays many modern solvers can yield satisfying solutions easily within a reasonable time. 

As we iterate through all $I\in S$, we find corresponding points between $I$ and $T$ and then solve the ILP. If $I$ and $T$ are different scenes, the positions of the corresponding points are completely random, and it is difficult to find a large set of inliers. Conversely, if $I$ and $T$ capture the same object, the corresponding points preserve relative positions in the two photos, and it is more likely to find a large set of inliers. Therefore, the ILP yields a high score only if $I$ and $T$ capture the same scene. 

Another property we can exploit is that a correct match $(A_i, B_i)$ usually has a low $g(A_i, B_i)$ score (where $g(A_i, B_i)$ is defined previously as  1-NN/2-NN) \cite{Lowe04}. We can use this to evaluate whether the inliers we found are indeed correct matches. Simply modify the objective function 
\[
    \max_{x_i\in\{0,1\}} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{50}x_i
\]
into 
\[
 \max_{x_i\in\{0,1\}} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{50}k_ix_i
\]
where 
\[
    k_i = 1 - g(A_i, B_i)
\]
This new objective function favors the pair of points that are correct matches to be selected as inliers. If $I$ and
$T$ are different scenes, it is very unlikely that the inliers we found have large $k_i$ because their surrounding features wouldn't match well. Again, the ILP yields a high score only if $I$ and $T$ capture the same scene.

Recall that $f_T(I)$ is a function indicating how well $I$ matches $T$. We can execute this procedure and define $f_T(I)$ as the maximum value of the objective function $\sum_{i=1}^{50}k_ix_i$. After iterating through all $I\in S$, we can find which of them receives the highest score and output its location $(I_{lon}, I_{lat})$ as an estimation of where $T$ is taken.

\section{Results}

This section shows the results of our algorithm and discusses implementation issues from three perspectives.

  \label{fig:result1}
\end{figure*}

To show that our algorithm and the ILP formulation indeed find correct correspondence between two images, we visualize the ``inliers'' found on original photos in Fig. \ref{fig:result1}. Fig. \ref{a} and \ref{b} show that the correct correspondence points are found when two images capture the same object from different perspectives. Fig. \ref{c} and \ref{d} show that when two images are different scenes, the correspondences found are a small set of completely random points.

\subsection{Comparing Target Image with the Dataset}

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{fig/5.png}
   \caption{A typical score distribution.}
   \label{fig:results2-1}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{fig/6.png}
   \caption{A typical distribution of number of matches.}
   \label{fig:results2-2}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{fig/7.png}
   \caption{Another typical score distribution, where the first place receives a much higher score than others.}
   \label{fig:results2-3}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{fig/8.png}
   \caption{Another typical distribution of the number of matches, where the first place gets many more matches than others.}
   \label{fig:results2-4}
\end{figure*}

After comparing each $I\in S$ with $T$, we consider the one with the highest score $f_T(I)$ as the correct answer. Fig. \ref{fig:results2-1} and \ref{fig:results2-2} show a typical distribution of $f_T(I)$ and the number of inliers found, respectively, and mark the right and wrong answers, where right answers are defined as the images that contain the same building that the target image captures. Right answers usually receive higher scores and have more inliers than wrong answers. Moreover, the image that receives the highest score is very likely to be correct. This provides a foundation for our final step -- output the label of the image with the highest $f_T(I)$. 

Fig. \ref{fig:results2-3} and \ref{fig:results2-4} show the score and number of inliers distribution of another target image. This time, the first place received a much higher score than the others. 

The execution time mainly depends on how much time we allow the ILP solver to run. We used the Gurobi solver \cite{gurobi} and set a 0.5-second time limit (this is enough for the solver to find a solution near what it would find after half an hour). In this case, it takes about 2 seconds to compare the target image with an image from the dataset and find the $f_T(I)$. Thus, for a dataset that consists of 800 photos, it takes about 30 minutes to process. 

\subsection{Overall Correctness}

We tested 13 target images (taken by smartphone) on the Channing Way dataset. 11 of them output the correct location, achieving 84.6\% correctness. One of the failure test cases is due to the target building being covered by scaffoldings in the images downloaded from Google Street View, but the scaffoldings do not exist anymore when we take the photo by ourselves. Although this situation reduces our overall correctness, this is the inherent weakness of comparing images from different sources. 


\section{Conclusion}

In this project, we proposed an algorithm that outputs where a given photo is taken by matching it with images in a dataset. The key idea is to formulate the matching problem of two images as an integer linear programming problem to find the inliers that preserve relative positions and have the highest similarity. Experimental results show that an overall correctness of 84.6\% is achieved.

% \section{Introduction}
% \label{sec:intro}

% Please follow the steps outlined below when submitting your manuscript to the IEEE Computer Society Press.
% This style guide now has several important modifications (for example, you are no longer warned against the use of sticky tape to attach your artwork to the paper), so all authors should read this new version.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Language}

% All manuscripts must be in English.

% \subsection{Dual submission}

% Please refer to the author guidelines on the \confName\ \confYear\ web page for a
% discussion of the policy on dual submissions.

% \subsection{Paper length}
% Papers, excluding the references section, must be no longer than eight pages in length.
% The references section will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the length of the references section.
% For example, a paper of eight pages with two pages of references would have a total length of 10 pages.
% {\bf There will be no extra page charges for \confName\ \confYear.}

% Overlength papers will simply not be reviewed.
% This includes papers where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those laid down by this style guide.
% Note that this \LaTeX\ guide already sets figure captions and references in a smaller font.
% The reason such papers will not be reviewed is that there is no provision for supervised revisions of manuscripts.
% The reviewing process cannot determine the suitability of the paper for presentation in eight pages if it is reviewed in eleven.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{The ruler}
% The \LaTeX\ style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the version submitted for review.
% The ruler is provided in order that reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without circumlocution.
% If you are preparing a document using a non-\LaTeX\ document preparation system, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to appear on the final output pages.
% The presence or absence of the ruler should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.
% The camera-ready copy should not contain a ruler.
% (\LaTeX\ users may use options of cvpr.sty to switch between different versions.)

% Reviewers:
% note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper --- this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly.
% Just use fractional references (\eg, this line is $087.5$), although in most cases one would expect that the approximate location will be adequate.


% \subsection{Paper ID}
% Make sure that the Paper ID from the submission system is visible in the version submitted for review (replacing the ``*****'' you see in this document).
% If you are using the \LaTeX\ template, \textbf{make sure to update paper ID in the appropriate place in the tex file}.


% \subsection{Mathematics}

% Please number all of your sections and displayed equations as in these examples:
% \begin{equation}
%   E = m\cdot c^2
%   \label{eq:important}
% \end{equation}
% and
% \begin{equation}
%   v = a\cdot t.
%   \label{eq:also-important}
% \end{equation}
% It is important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation.
% Just because you did not refer to it in the text does not mean some future reader might not need to refer to it.
% It is cumbersome to have to use circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page 3 column 1''.
% (Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not an alternative to equation numbers).
% All authors will benefit from reading Mermin's description of how to write mathematics:
% \url{http://www.pamitc.org/documents/mermin.pdf}.

% \subsection{Blind review}

% Many authors misunderstand the concept of anonymizing for blind review.
% Blind review does not mean that one must remove citations to one's own work---in fact it is often impossible to review a paper unless the previous citations are known and available.

% Blind review means that you do not use the words ``my'' or ``our'' when citing previous work.
% That is all.
% (But see below for tech reports.)

% Saying ``this builds on the work of Lucy Smith [1]'' does not say that you are Lucy Smith;
% it says that you are building on her work.
% If you are Smith and Jones, do not say ``as we show in [7]'', say ``as Smith and Jones show in [7]'' and at the end of the paper, include reference 7 as you would any other cited work.

% An example of a bad paper just asking to be rejected:
% \begin{quote}
% \begin{center}
%     An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
% \end{center}

%    In this paper we present a performance analysis of our previous paper [1], and show it to be inferior to all previously known methods.
%    Why the previous paper was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

%    [1] Removed for blind review
% \end{quote}


% An example of an acceptable paper:
% \begin{quote}
% \begin{center}
%      An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
% \end{center}

%    In this paper we present a performance analysis of the  paper of Smith \etal [1], and show it to be inferior to all previously known methods.
%    Why the previous paper was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

%    [1] Smith, L and Jones, C. ``The frobnicatable foo filter, a fundamental contribution to human knowledge''. Nature 381(12), 1-213.
% \end{quote}

% If you are making a submission to another conference at the same time, which covers similar or overlapping material, you may need to refer to that submission in order to explain the differences, just as you would if you had previously published related work.
% In such cases, include the anonymized parallel submission~\cite{Authors14} as supplemental material and cite it as
% \begin{quote}
% [1] Authors. ``The frobnicatable foo filter'', F\&G 2014 Submission ID 324, Supplied as supplemental material {\tt fg324.pdf}.
% \end{quote}

% Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.
% For conference submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the reviewer to go to a tech report for further details.
% Thus, you may say in the body of the paper ``further details may be found in~\cite{Authors14b}''.
% Then submit the tech report as supplemental material.
% Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.

% Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool that is widely known to be restricted to a single institution.
% For example, let's say it's 1969, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander, and you believe that the CVPR70 audience would like to hear about your
% solution.
% The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled ``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

% You can handle this paper like any other.
% Do not write ``We show how to improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].
% This time we tested the algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
% That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors.
% Instead write the following:
% \begin{quotation}
% \noindent
%    We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.
%    This system is new because it handles the following cases:
%    A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] did not  handle case B properly.
%    Ours handles it by including a foo term in the bar integral.

%    ...

%    The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't you know.
%    It displayed the following behaviours, which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...
% \end{quotation}
% As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention, reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as the authors.
% A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess.
% He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been contracted to solve problem B.

% \subsection{Miscellaneous}

% \noindent
% Compare the following:\\
% \begin{tabular}{ll}
%  \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
%  \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
% \end{tabular}\\
% See The \TeX book, p165.

% The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a sentence-ending space.
% So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.
% The provided \verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

% When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'', shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word).
% If you use the \verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.
% However, use it only when there are three or more authors.
% Thus, the following is correct:
%    ``Frobnication has been trendy lately.
%    It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
%    Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

% This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...'' because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.


% % Update the cvpr.cls to do the following automatically.
% % For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
% % chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors14} to
% % \cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors14}.

% \section{Formatting your paper}
% \label{sec:formatting}

% All text must be in a two-column format.
% The total allowable size of the text area is $6\frac78$ inches (17.46 cm) wide by $8\frac78$ inches (22.54 cm) high.
% Columns are to be $3\frac14$ inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a $\frac{5}{16}$ inch (0.8 cm) space between them.
% The main title (on the first page) should begin 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the page.
% The second and following pages should begin 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge.
% On all pages, the bottom margin should be $1\frac{1}{8}$ inches (2.86 cm) from the bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper;
% for A4 paper, approximately $1\frac{5}{8}$ inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the
% page.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Margins and page numbering}

% All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
% within a print area $6\frac{7}{8}$ inches (17.46 cm) wide by $8\frac{7}{8}$ inches (22.54 cm)
% high.
% %
% Page numbers should be in the footer, centered and $\frac{3}{4}$ inches from the bottom of the page.
% The review version should have page numbers, yet the final version submitted as camera ready should not show any page numbers.
% The \LaTeX\ template takes care of this when used properly.



% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Type style and fonts}

% Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used.
% If neither is available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
% appearance to Times to which you have access.

% MAIN TITLE.
% Center the title $1\frac{3}{8}$ inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of the first page.
% The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
% Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs;
% do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word).
% Leave two blank lines after the title.

% AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title
% and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type.
% This information is to be followed by two blank lines.

% The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

% MAIN TEXT.
% Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced.
% Do NOT use double-spacing.
% All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx.~$\frac{1}{6}$ inch or 0.422 cm).
% Make sure your text is fully justified---that is, flush left and flush right.
% Please do not place any additional blank lines between paragraphs.

% Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in \cref{fig:onecol,fig:short}.
% Short captions should be centred.

% \noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
% Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-, second-, and third-order headings.

% FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS.
% (For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction}) should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

% SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS.
% (For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements}) should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line before, and one after.
% If you require a third-order heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period and your text on the same line.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Footnotes}

% Please use footnotes\footnote{This is what a footnote looks like.
% It often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.
% Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).
% If you wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on which it is referenced.
% Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Cross-references}

% For the benefit of author(s) and readers, please use the
% {\small\begin{verbatim}
%   \cref{...}
% \end{verbatim}}  command for cross-referencing to figures, tables, equations, or sections.
% This will automatically insert the appropriate label alongside the cross-reference as in this example:
% \begin{quotation}
%   To see how our method outperforms previous work, please see \cref{fig:onecol} and \cref{tab:example}.
%   It is also possible to refer to multiple targets as once, \eg~to \cref{fig:onecol,fig:short-a}.
%   You may also return to \cref{sec:formatting} or look at \cref{eq:also-important}.
% \end{quotation}
% If you do not wish to abbreviate the label, for example at the beginning of the sentence, you can use the
% {\small\begin{verbatim}
%   \Cref{...}
% \end{verbatim}}
% command. Here is an example:
% \begin{quotation}
%   \Cref{fig:onecol} is also quite important.
% \end{quotation}

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{References}

% List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times, single-spaced, at the end of your paper.
% When referenced in the text, enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
% example~\cite{Authors14}.
% Where appropriate, include page numbers and the name(s) of editors of referenced books.
% When you cite multiple papers at once, please make sure that you cite them in numerical order like this \cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Alpher05,Authors14b,Authors14}.
% If you use the template as advised, this will be taken care of automatically.

% \begin{table}
%   \centering
%   \begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
%     \toprule
%     Method & Frobnability \\
%     \midrule
%     Theirs & Frumpy \\
%     Yours & Frobbly \\
%     Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
%   \caption{Results.   Ours is better.}
%   \label{tab:example}
% \end{table}

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

% All graphics should be centered.
% In \LaTeX, avoid using the \texttt{center} environment for this purpose, as this adds potentially unwanted whitespace.
% Instead use
% {\small\begin{verbatim}
%   \centering
% \end{verbatim}}
% at the beginning of your figure.
% Please ensure that any point you wish to make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.
% Resize fonts in figures to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths that render effectively in print.
% Readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic copy, may choose to print your paper in order to read it.
% You cannot insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

% When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use \verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below
% {\small\begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage{graphicx} ...
%    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
%                    {myfile.pdf}
% \end{verbatim}
% }


% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Color}

% Please refer to the author guidelines on the \confName\ \confYear\ web page for a discussion of the use of color in your document.

% If you use color in your plots, please keep in mind that a significant subset of reviewers and readers may have a color vision deficiency; red-green blindness is the most frequent kind.
% Hence avoid relying only on color as the discriminative feature in plots (such as red \vs green lines), but add a second discriminative feature to ease disambiguation.

% %------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \section{Final copy}

% You must include your signed IEEE copyright release form when you submit your finished paper.
% We MUST have this form before your paper can be published in the proceedings.

% Please direct any questions to the production editor in charge of these proceedings at the IEEE Computer Society Press:
